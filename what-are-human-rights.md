title: What are human rights?

# Human \\ rights are … <aside>Source : \\[Nickel, James, \\"Human Rights"](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2021/entries/rights-human/)<aside>

## :one: Universal rights

### Which means \\ that …

- All living humans – or perhaps all living persons – have human rights. One does not have to be a particular kind of person or a member of some specific nation or religion to have human rights. 
- People have human rights independently of whether they are found in the practices, morality, or law of their country or culture. 

### But …

- Some rights, such as the right to vote, are held only by adult citizens or residents and apply only to voting in one’s own country.
- Some human rights treaties focus on the rights of vulnerable groups such as minorities, women, indigenous peoples, and children

## :two: High-priority rights

### Which means \\ that …

- Human rights are matters of paramount importance and their violation a grave affront to justice.
- Human rights deal with very important goods, protections, and freedoms

### But …

- It does not mean, however, that human rights are absolute. Human rights should be understood as “resistant to trade-offs, but not too resistant”.
- They can in some cases be overridden by other considerations. For example, the right to freedom of movement can be restricted by public and private property rights, by restraining orders related to domestic violence, and by legal punishments.
