# Philosophy of the Body

## Ethics & Moral Philosophy
- What rights do I have over my body? \\ Am I free to do what I want with my body?
- How should we consider our body? Should we become the master of our body?

## Philosophy of Mind
- \\What does it mean to have a body? Do I have a body or am I a body? Does my body define who I am?
- What is the relationship between the material body and the soul? Can there be a mind without the body? Is the mind the same as the brain? Can consciousness be explained solely by physical phenomena?

## Philosophy of Culture
- \\How do artists use or represent the body?
- How is the body involved in the work environment? \\Is self-realization in work only possible in a job that relies on the mind rather than the body?
- Does technology offer a way to go beyond the inherent limits of the body? Is such a prospect desirable?

## Social and Political Philosophy
- \\How does society influence and shape the body? \\To what extent is the body not merely a natural reality but rather the subject of social norms and an expression of social identity? 
- Is a society a collective body? Are body metaphors in politics relevant?
- Are social injustices fundamentaly linked to the body? \\Is the body a source of discrimination and a target of oppressions?

## Epistemology and Metaphysics
- \\How do we know our body? Am I the most qualified to understand my body? Could my perception of my body be an illusion?
- Is the body just a mark of our finitude? Is the body nothing but the realm of our vulnerability and mortality?
