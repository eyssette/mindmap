“[E]ven if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds”

“[I]f any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.”

“[T]he meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.”

“[T]here ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered”

“[T]hough the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied.”

“That the only purpose for which power can be righfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.”

”An opinion that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard.”



**Only one situation** in which free speech can be impeded : harm to others

Even if an opinion is mostly false, there may be some **grain of truth** hidden within it

Even if the opinion is wholly false, the **confrontation** of ideas allows a **better understanding** of the **reasons** why the opinion is false 

Free speech **for any opinion** 

Harm only comes in the form of incitements to direct, illegitimate, action

Many people claim to be harmed by the statements and opinions of others

The opposing view might be true. We never know what we might be wrong about (= an appeal to our **epistemic fallibility**) 

When there is no public opposition to a righteous opinion, the idea becomes **a dead dogma** with no real effect on people's mind.

Words only may count as causing harm when they are direct incitements to harmful action
